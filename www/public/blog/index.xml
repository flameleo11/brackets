      <description>There are a lot of programmers complaining about usage of white-spaces as keywords and forcing indentation in Python, there are a lot of programmers who prefer curly braces over indenting, that&amp;rsquo;s it, for no reason, it&amp;rsquo;s just their taste, but, why did Brackets was created?
It was 2014, when I heard a friend complaining about Python and criticizing, saying he will never use Python because of indenting, so I did a really small Python codec to allow people use curly braces in their code, I published this module on PyPI and put a DO NOT USE IT line in the readme.</description>

      <description>Today we published a Jupyter kernel to add Brackets support to Jupyter, so from now on you can use Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s qtconsole and Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s notebooks with Python Brackets.
To install you can do
pip install ibpykernel  and after install is finished
python -m ibpykernel install --user  and to use it with notebook
jupyter notebook  and it&amp;rsquo;s available in create file menu
You can view this project on PyPI or on Github.</description>
