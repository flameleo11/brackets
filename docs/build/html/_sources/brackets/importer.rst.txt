Importer hooks
==============

Third way, of using Brackets with Python interpreter, is using the import hooks,
just import brackets, then import your .bpy file::

    import brackets
    import my_bpy_file

With ``brackets`` you can run your Brackets code directly, but with Python
interpreter you'll need to import your Brackets code.
