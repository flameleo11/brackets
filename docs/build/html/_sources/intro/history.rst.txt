History
=======

This project was started as a hobby project in 2014 because a friend was
complaining about indentation with Python. Later in 2017 I started working
on a new project, I needed a functional programming language, with powerful
anonymous functions, not like Python's lambdas, but, I didn't find a language
that could satisfy other needs we had in this project.

I wanted to use Python, but didn't want to subclass everything every time to
just add a method, I didn't want to import regex and write patterns and compile,
I didn't want to define functions and pass them to map/reduce, I wanted more,
a Python with all these abilities and functions, so I rewrote what I coded in
2014, and started this again, using this in my projects now.

Later, adding features to this, I decided to make tools to work with it, I
changed it from just codec to a complete replacement for Python, writing import
hooks, shell, and command line tools, changed the name, making it the
programming language to use instead of Python in my projects. Hosted on PyPI it
got plenty of downloads and I saw people like the idea in some of the
programming groups I'm in, I decided to dedicate time to Brackets and work on it
more seriously.
