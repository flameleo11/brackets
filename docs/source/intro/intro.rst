What is Brackets?
=================

Brackets is a complete high-level trying-to-be-functional (at least in its
syntax) programming language that is transpiled to Python, so basically it's a
source-to-source compiler, which, has its own runtime and tools, shell
environment and interpreter.

When I started this, the name of the project was cstyle, trying to bring {} to
Python to be used instead of indenting, later, trying to add functional syntax
to Python, I rewrote that code, named it Brackets, and further developed it to
be what it is today.

Basically, Brackets is Python, with optional indenting (You can either indent
your code, or use {} or mix both of them, you're free) without any performance
difference compared to Python. Brackets also brings a lot more sugar with it
than just the syntax.
