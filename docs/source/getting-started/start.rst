Using Brackets
==============

There are three ways of using Brackets with Python. Easiest way is to use
Brackets interpreter and shell. Brackets comes with its own shell and
interpreter, to start Brackets shell, just type ``brackets`` in your command
line environment, terminal or console::

    brackets

this will bring up the Brackets shell, were you can write and execute Brackets
code. You can use and import any Python libraries and files you want. Remember,
all Brackets code is Python compatible and all Python code can run in Brackets.

If you don't pass a file name to ``brackets`` it will bring up the Brackets
shell, but if you give it a file name, it will execute that file for you::

    brackets hello.bpy
